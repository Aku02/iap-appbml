This repository is a collection of material designed for a 2017 IAP class at MIT titled "Applied Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Machine Learning." It includes:

- Lecture notes (pdf)
- Python, R, and Stan coding exercises
- Toy Datasets

The material is largely a "remixing" of two textbooks: Statistical Rethinking, and Bayesian Data Analysis 3.

Installation Directions:
Required Software: Python 2.7, pystan, R, and RStan.
We recommend Anaconda as an OS-agnostic solution to installing Python and Stan without administrative privileges. 
Python code is written for 2.7, but is easy to convert to Python 3 compatible code if needed.
