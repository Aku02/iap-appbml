This repository is a collection of material designed for a 2017 IAP class at MIT titled "Applied Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Machine Learning." It includes:

- Lecture notes (in pdf format)
- Python, R, and Stan coding exercises
- Toy Datasets (csv format)

The material is largely a "remixing" of two textbooks: Statistical Rethinking, and Bayesian Data Analysis 3.

# Installation:
Required Software: 
- Python 2.7
- pystan
- R
- RStan.

We recommend Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as an OS-agnostic solution to installing Python and pystan without administrative privileges. For Windows users, Anaconda also provides a GUI. Once you have anaconda, you can install pystan without root by using:
> conda install -c anaconda pystan

To install R without root, see here: http://unix.stackexchange.com/posts/149455/revisions



Python code is written for 2.7, but is easy to convert to Python 3 compatible code if needed.
